# SDEV140-M02-Programming-Assignment
 
This project is composed of two parts:

Part 1:
This program prompts the user to enter two primary colors (red, blue, or yellow). It uses While loops to ensure that the user enters valid colors. If the user enters an invalid answer, the program will keep asking until a valid color is entered. Once two valid, non-matching colors are entered, the program displays the combined secondary color based on the two primary colors.

Part 2:
This program prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer and calculates the factorial of that number. The program ensures that the user enters a valid non-negative integer and displays the factorial result.
